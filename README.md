# Simple-Linear-Regression-using-R

In ML Algorithms we have :
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning


In **Supervised Learning** we have :
1. Regression
2. Classification

     Firstly, we discuss about different types of *Regressions*.
      1. Linear Regression
          1. Simple Linear Regression
          2. Multi-linear Regression
      2. Logistic Regression
      3. Lasso Regression 
      4. Ridge Regression
     
     
 *In this repository we discuss about Simple Linear Regression*
 
 ## Simple Linear Regression:
          It is applicable when relationship between input variable and output variable is linear, that is it should have positive or negative correlation between input and output variable
